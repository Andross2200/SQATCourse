One of the main issues with Hellolink.java is that, it exposes a constructor, which initializes a vector with a certain amount of parameters. Later on this could be a problem, since nobody assures that the users of our code won’t access out of bounds elements of our vector, which should be handled inside our functions. To do this, one can implement the public void IndexOutOfBoundsTest() function, which does that exactly. This function is simple, it initializes a local variable of our Hellolink.java class and then asserts against if the access of that vector raises an exception with the help of assertThrows.\nThere can be cases, when during TDD one implements the tests first, but softly doesn’ want them to fail at first. This goal can be achieved by simply putting the @Disabled annotation with a reasonable message in the test cases.\nSometimes the timing of the test running is important, therefore one needs to put certain blocks on the execution of test functions. This can be done by annotating, the test case with @Timeout(NUM), where NUM is the number if milliseconds that the test will be blocked.\n\nTasks 2\n\nTry to write a test such that, public int multiply(int aLeft, int aRight) throws an exception\nWrite a test such that certain cases inside the parameterized tests will be disabled",

If the assumptions turn out to be wrong, the unit test has failed. A unit is a method or function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition (SUT and CUT)\n\n\n\nSUT stand for system under test, and some people like to use CUT (class under test or code under test). When you test something, you refer to the thing you’re testing as the SUT/CUT.\n\n\nNow I think the best way to understand this is to check how it looks in code, take a look at the following example.",

    "text": "Example 1.\nTake a look at the code written in sample_1, which will be disected in the forthcoming few sections. The project resides under the folder app and the rest are build files generally, where settings.gradle what interests us. Inside the gradle settings, we can inspect what we will be testing during this first example. Namely, rootProject.name will tell us the package where the class resides and include will contain the name of it. If we go to App.java we can see that the SUT/CUT is class App. There are a few practical things to note at this point\n\nThe CUT is public which renders it testable from the outside, otherwise it would be extremely hard to “break” into the internals of the class at hand\nAll the functions that are implemented inside the class are public as well, which is also necessary for testing purposes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case of sample_1/App.java what is the CUT? What is the smallest unit of code that can be tested?\n\n\n\nIt is always subjective to the actual codebase that you are working on, what would be the smallest amount/unit of code that can be tested by these unit testing techniques. Usually it is a good descriptor of the codebase at hand on how big is this thing actually.\n\n\nGoing further, to do unit testing it is a necessity to understand the actual code at hand, which in this case is the following\n\nThe class has three constructors, a default App(), a simple overload App(int aNumber), which sets only private member of the class and App(boolean aWait), which makes the constructor wait for a certain amount of time to evaluate.1\nHas a simple function returning a greeting String getGreeting()\nThe usual java public static void main(String[] args) function, nothing special about it\nA print function, public static void callNavi(String aMessage), which simply forwards the arguments to the standard output\nA multiply function public int multiply(int aLeft, int aRight), which gets two arguments, and multiplies two numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding these functionalities, which ones are actually testable? And if they are testable, is it justified at all to test them?\n\n\n\nNow you can see sometimes, a function which is testable might not be a good candidate for tests because simply it is irrelevant and other cases there might be functions are not testable and relevant, which is the worst case possible in terms of testing.\n\n\nTo test the functionalities inside sample_1 we have to understand the build system a little bit better. Take a look at build.gradle file and see what it does in terms of helping us test the previous functionnalities. The structure is the following, plugins tells us what class/package/application are we building with the help of gradle. the next one is one of the most important ones, which is repositories, which tells gradle wherefrom to fetch the necessary libraries and packages to build and run the project and its dependencies. The next one is dependencies which as the name tells lists all the dependencies needed by our application. The testing block specifies the actual testing libraries that we will use throught the project to run the implemented tests. The last one is application, which defines what is the main class, the main entry point, which can be used by the frameworks.\nNow, let’s take a look at the already implemented test inside Apptest.java. The structure is the following\n\nIt starts by importing all the necessary packages, it is nothing special\nIt is a public class so the unit testing framework can access all the details inside it\nInside the class there is one member App mApp, which is basically the application that we are about to test.\nHere comes the cool part, the first function that will be run by our unt testing framework (junit5) is the usual Setup function with the @Before annotation. This function simply runs only once before all the tests are being run by our framework. In this case it is simply constructing our App class with 0 in the constructor argument.\nNext the function multiplicationOfZeroIntegereShouldReturnZero is being implemented. The usual test functions shall be annotated with @Test. Here comes the interesting part, inside this function there are assertions, which means the test is assumptions and asserting against them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, can you tell what might be the problem if we have multiple assertions inside a single test function?\n\n\n\nImagine having 10.000 tests and having multiple assertions inside them, how would you be able to pinpoint where the implementation might have gone wrong?\n\n\n\nThe similar function multiplicationOfZeroIntegereShouldReturnZeroWithMember has the same-ish functionality, however if you take a look it doesn’t have an instantiation of the class that will be tested during the evaluation.\nbeforeAffectsTest is simply demonstrating that one can just assert with a test function, which usually raises awareness for an unimplemented test case or in TDD tells the developer that this functionality need to be developed further.\nAnd at last the TearDown function with cleans up all the necessary memory/setups/etc after running the unit tests.\n\nAfter seeing how this code looks like, one can go further and pose the following definition on what is a unit test.",

They can be accessed without the instantiation of a class or any type, it can only access static data and they belong to the class or “namespace” where they reside. These can be quite tricky to mock, because there is no instance to tweak here.

Lets start at the basics first to reach the point, where we are braced with the knowledge to test such complicated chain-of-mocks examples.\n\n\nMocking a simple function\nFirst check out the NetworkConnectionTest.java\n\nThis test class start by doing a BlackMagic() as a Setup function by instantiating the NetworkConnection class\nThe HttpRequestReturnsNotNull() test case simply tests if the GetHttpRequest() function returns String containing a space\nNow the most interesting for is the HttpRequestReturnsNull() where the actual mocking happens\n\nFirst we need to specify, which class we would like to mock mNetworkConnection = mock( NetworkConnection.class );\nThe next step is when( mNetworkConnection.GetHttpRequest()).thenReturn(\" \"); to alter the functionality of the original class\nAsserting against the altering of the original functionality by assertEquals(\" \", mNetworkConnection.GetHttpRequest() );\n\n\nThis simple example shows that, basically with mocks we can alter the behaviour of any function inside our implementation. However, the first example is much more complicated than that, because there are some internal local variables initialized by 3rdparty functionalities, which makes mock-injection extremely hard.\n\n\nProblems with testing GetHttpRequest() function\nThe main issues with public String GetHttpRequest() throws MalformedURLException, IOException are the following\n\nThe first initialization is complicated as it is. URLConnection type on the left-hand-side initialized by a new URL class’s openConnection() function. This will be extremely challenging because we can’t access these from the outside, these are local functionalities and local variables. Further, URLConnection is public abstract class which is hard to mock\nThe next invocation, setting the rquest property on a local variable, which is challenging to handle\nForward, the inputstream handling is based on URLConnection type local variable, where the getInputStream() function needs to be mocked\nIn the try block a Scanner type is instantiated, where this needs to be mocked as well where the fact, public final class just complicates mocking\nInside the scanning try block only the useDelimiter() function needs to be mocked, however it is a bit complicated as discussed before\n\nTL;DR this task is challenging because there is the technique chain-of-mocks that need to be applied sequentally complicated by abstract and final classes that need to be mocked out.\n\n\nSupporting video",
